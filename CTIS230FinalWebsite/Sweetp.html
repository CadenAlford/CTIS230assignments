    <h3 class = "iheads">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class = "ingredients">
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Onion Powder</li>
        <li>Oil (Any type. I use Avacado Oil.</li>
        <li>Chili Powder</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1-2 Sweet Potatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class = "iheads">Preperation (5-10min)</h3>
    <p class = "paras">The preperation for this dish is simple and easy. Wash 1-2 sweet potatoes. Then, chop the sweet potatoes into your desired shape. 
    I normally cut them into wedges for convenience. Once cut, take the sweet potatoes and place them into a bowl. Next, cover them in a little bit of your oil of choice. 
    Then take the spices listed in the ingredients section and season to your desire. I suggest being generous with the spices you want to shine through. 
    Lastly, rub the seasoning into your sweet potatoes using your hands, making sure that every surface of the sweet potato is covered.

    <h3 class = "iheads">Cooking (20min)</h3>
    <h4 class = "iheads"> Air Fryer</h5>
    <p class = "paras">
        For air fryer users, place your chopped and seasoned sweet potatoes in your air fryer's basket. 
        Set the air fryer's temp to 400 degrees fahrenheit. The cook time varies depending on how many potatoes you have cut up. For one potato, I suggest cooking for about 15-17 minutes. 
        For two potatoes, cook them 20 minutes. At the end of the timer, enjoy!
    </p>
    <h4 class = "iheads">Oven</h5>
        For oven users, place your chopped and seasoned sweet potatoes evenly across a baking sheet. Then set the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit and let pre-heat.
        When finished, bake your sweet potatoes for around 30 minutes or until they are cooked to your desire. Enjoy!
