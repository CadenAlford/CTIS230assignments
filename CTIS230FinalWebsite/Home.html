    <h3 class = "heads">My Story</h3>
    <p class = "paras"> Hello! My name is Caden Alford. I am an incoming freshman at the University of North Carolina: Chapel Hill. After a stressful sophomore year filled with AP classes, I weighed 270lbs. 
        This was the heaviest that I have ever been. I lacked energy, confidence, and many other things. About a year ago, we were launched into a global pandemic, forcing us to stay at home. 
        I decided to use this time to my advantage and began changing my eating habits. I started with the Keto diet and many months later transitioned to a diet filled with clean and lean foods combined with a calorie deficit. 
        Over the past year or so, I have been able to lose around 60lbs. 
        I have now acquired much of what I lost being at my heaviest and much more. For example, I grew up being enveloped with a wide variety of foods and flavors. I’m a foodie. However, before my transition in eating habits, I never quite understood the power that food has on your body.
        At the end of the day, food is fuel for your body and mind. When you eat better, you feel better and I’m here to spread some of the recipes and tips that have helped me along my journey.
